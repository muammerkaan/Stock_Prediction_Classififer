# Stock_Prediction_Classififer
The goal of this project is to predict whether the stock price of the current day will be higher or lower than the previous day using a binary classifier.
This project involves:

# Data Exploration
* Define a function to run basic analysis on a set of data.
* Apply the function to each of our datasets.
* Observe trends and the validity of our data.

# Data Peprocessing
* Sort all datasets by date.
* Create dependant/target variable.
* Observe the distribution of the target variable across all datasets.

# Feature Engineering
* Create 4 new features that could be used to enhance the accuracy of our predictive model.

# Classical Machine Learning
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forrest
* Gradient Boosting Ensemble

# Deep Learning
* Tensorflow
